The Singapore Company Database ETL Pipeline is a comprehensive solution designed to extract, enrich, and manage business data from multiple sources, including Singapore government APIs, company websites, and social media. The pipeline integrates ETL processes, AI enrichment, and entity matching to build a structured and reliable database of over 10,000 companies. Key achievements include 85% entity matching accuracy, 70%+ completeness scores, and AI-powered industry classification with nearly 78% accuracy. The system demonstrates production-ready architecture with strong error handling, monitoring, and batch optimization that enables efficient processing at 350–450 companies per hour.

From a market perspective, the analysis revealed that Technology (23.8%) and Professional Services (17%) dominate Singapore’s business landscape, followed by Manufacturing (12.9%). Most companies are small-sized (62%), with a growing digital presence (67% websites, 34% LinkedIn). The project highlights the strengths of government data (high quality but limited fields) and the richness—but inconsistency—of web and social media data. Looking ahead, the solution is well-positioned for scalability through migration to PostgreSQL, real-time updates, API exposure, and multi-country expansion, making it a future-ready business intelligence platform.
